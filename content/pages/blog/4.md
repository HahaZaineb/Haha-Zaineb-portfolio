I believe that being a GDSC (Google Developer Students Club) member is an experience worth mentioning for it provided me with many opportunities.


1.  I got to explore Machine Learning by attending a bootcamp and it's an interesting asset for one to keep in their pocket.

2.  I, also, explored Cybersecurity and participated in a CTF  (Capture The Flag) competition and won 2nd place in a team of 3.

3.  It also was the first place that intoduced me to Blockchain.


Overall, GDSC was the place I explored many fields and decided on what my career will be.

I was a Marketing Department member when I first joined AIESEC-Sfax Local Committe. I then applied for the iCOMM and Education Manager position and got selected. My job description included:

● Follow-up and support for NEC (National Education Cycle) and LEC (Local Education Cycle) implementation


● MX (Membership experience) standards track report to SLB (Sfax Leadership Body)


● iCOMM (internal communication) campaigns planification and execution


● Creating tracking tools in synergy with IM (Information Management) department


● Analyze the NMS (National Membership Survey) responses


● TM (Talent Management) buddy system, guiding MX standards implementation


● Onboarding tracking of new members

This experience lasted 6 months and provided me with exceptional experience in *Talent Management, Graphic Design, Video Editing, Tracking tools creation and communication skills.*

Also, During this experience I raised an LST (Local Support Team) of two, designed their Job Description and led them for three months in creating a hub for the Local Committee and Creating content during my absence due to my unavailibility at Sfax during those three months. Which helped me develop *Leadership Skills, and Managing a team* completely online.

In AIESEC, we hosted events for youth, and for each event an organizing committe is selected with departments according to the needs of the event.

For this event, YouthSpeak Maghreb4SDGs which was a hackathon where contestants competed with projects about specific SDGs to then be selected to compete on the national level and then on a regional level, I was in charge of the Logistics Department where I led three members new to the key area to provide the necessary logistics for the success of the event (mainly Food and Drinks). 

We ended up providing the Event with four sponsors. It was overall an enriching experience which further developed my *Leadership and organizational skills* along with *contract management, Teamwork and Negotiation.*

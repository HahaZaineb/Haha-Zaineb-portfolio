Doesn't matter if you are a Web2 or Web3 developer, HTML, CSS and Javascript remain the fundamentals of any programmer and/or developer. And this course provided the necessary knowledge to:

1.  Think critically about how to solve a problem using programming.

2.  Write JavaScript programs using functions, for loops, and conditional statements.

3.  Use HTML to construct a web page with paragraphs, divs, images, links, and lists.

4.  Add styles to a web page with CSS IDs and classes.

5.  Make a web page interactive (Made a small webpage with JavaScript commands like alert, onClick, onChange, adding input features like an image canvas, button, and slider.)

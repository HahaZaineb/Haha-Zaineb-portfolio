With the increasing importance of high-quality data, ensuring data provenance, quality, and governance has become critical. High-quality data is the backbone no matter what application is used. This marketplace facilitates secure and transparent data trading between buyers and sellers, ensuring compliance with privacy laws. By using blockchain technology, our platform guarantees the integrity and authenticity of the data source, sellers and buyer. Our prototype addresses major concerns in data selling, providing a comprehensive solution. Key features include robust seller authentication processes to verify the identity and credibility of data providers, mechanisms to prevent data duplication, and a user-friendly pricing model that ensures fairness and transparency in transactions. Users of our platform can trade data with confidence, knowing that the data they receive is genuine and of high quality. This marketplace not only enhances trust between buyers and sellers but also promotes a more efficient and reliable data economy. The Cardano blockchain's inherent security and transparency make it an ideal foundation for this innovative data marketplace, positioning it as a leading solution in the field of data exchange for AI applications.
